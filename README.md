DeepLPC: A Deep Learning Approach to Augmented Kalman Filter-Based Single-Channel Speech Enhancement

Summary:
1. LPC is a key parameter for speech coding, speech recognition, and speech enhancement using Kalman Filter. However, in noisy conditions the accuracy of LPC estimates become deteriorate and degrades the performance of speech processing systems requireing accurate LPCs.
2. DeepLPC is a Deep Learning framework for accurately estimating the LPC parameters in noisy condition.
