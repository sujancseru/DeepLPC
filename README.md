# DeepLPC

DeepLPC is a Deep Learning framework proposed in [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9411829)

Introduction:
1. LPC is a key parameter for speech coding, speech recognition, and speech enhancement using Kalman Filter. However, in noisy conditions the accuracy of LPC estimates become deteriorate and degrades the performance of speech processing systems requireing accurate LPCs.
2. DeepLPC is a Deep Learning framework for accurately estimating the LPC parameters in noisy condition. 
3. The accurate estimates of LPC are used in designining Augmented Kalman Filter for Speech Enhancement.
